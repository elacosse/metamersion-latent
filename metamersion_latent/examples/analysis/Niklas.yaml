"scenes": "1: Niklas is traveling through a desolate mountain range at night, trying to clear his mind of his worrying thoughts. He sees a strange light coming from below him, and decides to investigate. As he descends, he discovers an unusual temple made of stone with an ancient statue of a dragon in the center. The statue appears to be asleep and Niklas realizes that the dragon is an embodiment of his own sleeping problem. OBJ: A waning moon hanging in the sky.\n\n2: Niklas ventures closer to the dragon and finds a large book tucked beneath its chest. He begins to read the text, which explains how to cure one's sleeping disorder using a combination of herbal remedies and mindful activities. Niklas is amazed by what he reads and decides to try it out for himself. OBJ: A pile of old scrolls beside the book.\n\n3: On the next morning, Niklas wakes up feeling refreshed and energized. He notices that the dragon\u2019s eyes are now open and he can feel its power radiating across the mountain range. He smiles as he realizes that the dragon symbolizes his new-found ability to sleep soundly and peacefully. OBJ: A small stream trickling down the mountainside.\n\n4: Niklas takes a deep breath in and begins his journey back up the mountain. As he climbs, he notices a pack of wolves following him. He decides to stay still, but as they get closer they suddenly disperse instead of attacking him. He wonders if they were protecting him and realizes that they may be symbolic of his inner strength. OBJ: A tree with a thick canopy of branches.\n\n5: After some time, Niklas reaches the top of the mountain where he finds a garden filled with various herbs and plants. A wise woman appears from behind the trees and she tells him that these plants are useful for natural healing. She points out certain herbs that can help with anxiety, depression and insomnia, exactly what Niklas has been looking for. OBJ: A single sunbeam breaking through the clouds.\n\n6: Niklas is grateful for the woman's wisdom, so he offers her his own knowledge about meditation and marihuana as potential sources for relief from his sleeping disorder. The woman considers his advice thoughtfully before nodding her head in agreement and whispering under her breath something about \"the power of balance.\"  Niklas feels at peace as he returns home, knowing that he has gained knowledge from this incredible journey that will help him find balance in life and overcome his sleeping disorder. OBJ: A flock of birds taking flight in the sky."
