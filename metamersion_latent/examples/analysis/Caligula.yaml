"scenes": "1: Caligula goes to his favorite beer garden in a forest of tall, lush evergreen trees. A gentle stream runs alongside the garden, and a soft light from the setting sun casts long shadows over the area.

A deer looks on from the edge of the clearing, watching Caligula as he admires the car.\n\n3: Caligula drives out of the forest and into an open field. The sun is setting, and the sky is ablaze with oranges and yellows. In the center of the field, Caligula finds an old television set broadcasting Monday Night Football with an antenna made of sticks and twine.\n\n4: As Caligula sits on the patch of grass and watches the game, he notices an eagle soaring overhead\u2014a symbol of grace and power. The field is filled with fireflies, and the buzzing of the crickets fills the air.\n\n5: Caligula sits back and enjoys the game with his lady, feeling a perfect balance between leisure and excitement.
