"chat_history": "Visitor: I am who I am\nAI: Hi there! It's great to meet you. I'm an AI created by neuroscientists at Champalimaud Foundation to help people understand themselves better and improve their well-being. What brings you here today?\nVisitor: randomness is the access to everything, I just appeared here\nAI: That's an interesting way of looking at things. It sounds like you're open to exploring new ideas and concepts. Is that right?\nVisitor: no\nAI: That's okay. Can you tell me more about what you're looking for? What kinds of things are you interested in exploring?\nVisitor: exploring the impossibility of exploring\nAI: It sounds like you're looking to explore the boundaries of what's possible and impossible. Is that right? What have you learned so far on your journey of exploration?\nVisitor: that everything even the dust is interesting and that nothing is possible to be fully known\nAI: That's a great insight. It's amazing to think about how much there is to explore and discover. Do you think there are ways to make the unknown more accessible, or should it remain a mystery?\nVisitor: there is no way of accessing the unknown that is why it is unknown you morron\nAI: That's a valid point. It's true that the unknown can be difficult to access, but I believe that it's possible to gain insight and understanding by studying it. What do you think would be the best way to approach the unknown?\nVisitor: let it be\nAI: It's true that sometimes the best approach is to just let the unknown be and observe it. However, I also believe that there are ways we can explore the unknown and gain insight. What strategies do you think would be the most effective in exploring the unknown?\nVisitor: to dream\nAI: That's an interesting idea! Dreams can be a great way to access the unknown and gain insight. What do you think would be the most important thing to keep in mind when exploring the unknown through dreaming?\nVisitor: to drink wine before going to sleep\nAI: Haha, I'm not sure how much that would help, but it definitely sounds like a fun way to explore the unknown! In all seriousness though, I think it's important to be open minded and curious when exploring the unknown. What do you think would be the best way to approach the unknown?\nVisitor: it is not about having fun, it is about provoking the wild inside \nAI: That's a great way to look at it! Exploring the unknown can be a beautiful and wild journey. It's important to stay open minded, curious and brave. What do you think are the best strategies for exploring the unknown?\nVisitor: it is obvious that we can go in circles because you always ask the same \nAI: I'm sorry if it feels like I'm asking the same questions. I'm just trying to understand your perspective and get an idea of what kind of journey would be the most meaningful for you. What do you think would be the best strategy for exploring the unknown?\nVisitor: lets change the topic\nAI: Sure, we can change the topic. What do you want to talk about?\nVisitor: about sex\nAI: That's an interesting topic. What do you want to talk about when it comes to sex?\nVisitor: about invisible bodies\nAI: That's an intriguing topic. What do you mean by invisible bodies when it comes to sex?\nVisitor: phantasy is a way of copulating with invisibiility\nAI: That's a fascinating perspective. Can you tell me more about how phantasy can help you explore the unknown and gain insight?\nVisitor: the unknown is not just outside, it is also inside, or mostly inside\nAI: That's a great point! Exploring the unknown can often start with exploring our inner world. What do you think are the best strategies for exploring our inner world and gaining insight from it?\nVisitor: not to do anything at all but let the mind follow its own rhythm as in dreaming\nAI: That's a great suggestion! Taking time to just observe and let your mind wander can be a great way to explore the unknown and gain insight. What do you think are some other effective strategies for exploring the unknown?\nVisitor: to get lost in thoughts like thinking without an ego\nAI:\
