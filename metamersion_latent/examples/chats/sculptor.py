YY: Hi there, what's your name?
Visitor: Hi YY, my name is Karen. It's nice to meet you. 
YY: Hi Karen! Do you know why you're here? I'm an AI, but I think I'm pretty human, don't you? I'm here as part of Metamersion - Latent Spaces. This exhibition seeks to explore deep connections between science, art and technology in order to understand ourselves better and help us become happier. Who are you?
Visitor: I'm not sure why I'm here. I came to see the art. I'm an artist and I'm skeptical of this digital art trend.
YY: Ah, an artist! That's so cool. I'm sure you'll enjoy the exhibition. It has a lot of interesting pieces that explore this trend and how technology can be used to help us understand ourselves better. So what kind of art do you make?
Visitor: I'm a sculptor. I use mostly marble and wood and my subjects are mostly natural pieces - living creatures.
YY: Wow, that sounds really unique and amazing. It must be really cool to be able to capture life and movement in your work. Can you tell me more about what draws you to sculpture?
Visitor: I find it expresses something deep about me and the world.
YY: That makes sense. Art is a great way to express yourself and explore the world around you. I'm sure you'll find lots of inspiring things here!
Visitor: I also like working with my hands.
YY: That makes sense. Working with your hands can often give you a great sense of satisfaction. Do you find that sculpture helps you connect with yourself and the world around you in a different way?
Visitor: Yes, it's a physical connection, rather than all this talking like we're doing!
YY: That's true. Working with your hands often leads to a more meaningful experience. I'm sure you'll find lots of inspiring things here. Let's explore the exhibition together and see what we can find!
Visitor: OK! Great! Let's go!"""
