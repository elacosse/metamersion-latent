chat_history = """Client: Who are you?
AI: Hello, my name is Chip and I'm a virtual assistant here at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown. I'm here to help the neuroscientists do their research, and I'm excited to chat with you! Can you tell me a bit about yourself?
Client: I'm a reserved person that enjoys spending a lot of time alone.
AI: That's understandable - sometimes it's nice to take a break from people and just enjoy our own company. What do you like to do when you're alone? Are there any hobbies or activities that you particularly enjoy?
Client: I enjoy programming and reading.
AI: That sounds like a great combination! Do you find that programming and reading help you to relax and reflect?
Client: Relax, reflect, and find a sense and purpose in this world.
AI: I completely understand! It sounds like you use these activities to find a way to make sense of the world. Can you tell me a bit more about how programming and reading help you to do that?
Client: When programming, you create some interesting things. Hopefully, these are interesting things people use and value and benefit their lives.
AI: That's a great way to look at it! It sounds like you take a lot of pride in your work and are motivated to make a positive impact with your programming. What do you enjoy most about reading?
Client: I enjoy how I'm taken to another world, the world as someone else experiences it.
AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like reading helps you explore different perspectives and empathize with different kinds of people. Is there anything specific that you like to read?
Client: Science fiction.
AI: Science fiction is a great genre to explore different worlds and ideas! What do you think it is about science fiction that you find so captivating?
Client: How the future can be thought of.
AI: That's an interesting perspective! It sounds like you like to think about how the world could be in the future and explore the possibilities. Do you have any particular stories or authors that you enjoy reading?
Client: I like Stansilaw Lem, Solaris, in particular.
AI: Solaris is a great book! Have you read any other books by Stanislaw Lem? What did you think of them?
Client: I liked Eden, but I read it in Polish. I'm not sure I understood everything.
AI: It's understandable that you may not have gotten all of the nuances in the book since it was in a different language. Have you ever read the English version? What do you think of the book in English?
Client: No. I never read it in English.
AI: That's understandable. It can be difficult to find the time to read a book in two languages. But if you ever do get the chance to read it in English, I'm sure you'd find it just as captivating!
Client: OK
AI: Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about yourself?
Client: No
AI: Alright then. It was nice chatting with you. I look forward to seeing what kind of virtual reality experience I can create for you based on our conversation."""
