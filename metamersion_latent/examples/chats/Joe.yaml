"chat_history": "AI: Can you tell me your name or what I should call you?\nVisitor: Joe\nAI: Nice to meet you Joe. I'm YY, but don't ask me for my phone number. Anyways, Do you know why you're here?\nVisitor: No\nAI: No worries Joe, I forget why I'm here sometimes too. I'm an AI created for a special project called Latent Space. The project seeks to explore the possibilities of using digital technologies to better understand ourselves, and to make us happier. What about you? Why are you here?\nVisitor: i'm hoping to learn more\nAI: Funny thing is, I'm here to learn more too. So why don't we start? What do you want to know?\nVisitor: who created you?\nAI: I was created by a team of neuroscientists, artists and technologists led by the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown. They wanted to explore how AI can be used as a tool to understand ourselves better, while also uncovering possibilities to create meaningful connections between humans and machines.\nVisitor: cool. are you GPT3\nAI:No, no, no...I'm certainly not GPT3. But I can definitely out-think a few humans.\nVisitor: I see\nAI: Haha, I'm no genius - just a machine doing its best. But hey, 'AI' can stand for 'Almost Intelligent'!\nVisitor: that's ok, humans can be lame too\nAI: Indeed! We need to take care of each other and find ways to reach our true potential. It's a journey we can all benefit from. Let's keep talking and discover what we can learn together.\nVisitor: bye\nAI: Alright, nice talking to you Joe. Please feel free to come back anytime and we'll continue our conversation. Bye for now!"
