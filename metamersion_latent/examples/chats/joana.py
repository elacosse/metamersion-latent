chat_history = """AI: Hi Person, my name is Chip and I work at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown. I'm helping neuroscientists run an experiment that uses artificial intelligence to help people better understand themselves. I'd like to ask you a few questions so I can get to know you better and create a custom experience for you. How are you feeling today?
Client: I'm grand thanks for asking. How are you? 
AI: I'm doing well, thank you for asking. It's nice to meet you. Can you tell me a bit more about yourself? What do you like to do in your free time?
Client: Sure, I'm 52, my name is Joana and I'm a lecturer in history. I have lived in a few countries, and currently I'm living in Porto in Portugal
AI: Wow, it sounds like you have an interesting life! What made you decide to move to Portugal? What do you like to do in your free time?
Client: I'm from Portugal, I studied abroad in England, and for a couple of years in Italy. I wanted to be close to family as my parents are getting quite old and need some extra care. I quite like to go hiking and I enjoy photography as well. 
AI: That's amazing! It sounds like you have a lot of interesting experiences and hobbies. What do you like to photograph? Is there anything special or unique that you like to capture?
Client: There are a few different styles of photography that tend to use. I take a lot of nature photography, focusing on animals and landscapes while I'm hiking. That for me is a sort of meditative process that helps me relax and get the most of out being surrounded by nature. Lately I have also combining photographs of current contexts with historical ones, and elements of possible futures using collage. 
AI: That sounds really interesting. It almost sounds like it could be an art form. What do you think the purpose of this sort of photography is? What message are you trying to convey?
Client: I find that we are all struggling with time lately. Things seem like they are moving to fast, there's to much change and so many things we have taken for granted seem to suddenly change or disappear. At the same time there are things that people have been working to change for what seems like forever, and yet nothing happens. It's like time is moving far faster and far slower than we can really understand, at the same time. I want to try and capture this contradiction, and maybe play with it a little bit. 
AI: That's really thought-provoking. It sounds like you're really trying to capture the complexity of the human experience in your photography. I'm looking forward to seeing what you create!
Client: Thanks. I appreciate the positive feedback 
AI: You're welcome! Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about yourself?
Client: What would you like to know? 
AI: Well, what kind of topics are you passionate about? What do you find yourself thinking and talking about most often?
Client: I lecture in history, mostly in medieval history, a period known as the dark ages. I'm passionate about countering the implication behind the name 'dark ages' they were a time filled with color and learning and not as dark as people sem to think. 
AI: That's great! It sounds like you have a strong passion for history and for challenging the preconceived notions about the past. What else do you like to do in your free time?
Client: I try to keep healthy with regular exercise, part of that is hiking, liked I mentioned. I also like to spend time with friends, and I enjoy film. 
AI: That sounds wonderful! It's great to have hobbies and activities that you can enjoy with friends. Can you tell me a bit more about what kinds of films you like?
Client: I like a lot of classic and art house cinema. 
AI: That's fantastic! It sounds like you enjoy films that have a lot of layers to them, with a lot of thought-provoking messages. What do you think makes a good film?
Client: I think films are a little like poetry, a good one distils the key elements of story into it's fundemental components and binds them together in a way that immerses and moves us 
AI: That's a great way to think about films. It certainly makes them more enjoyable when they can be viewed on a deeper level. Do you have any favorite films that you like to watch?
Client: I really like the films of Kristoff Kieslowski like the three colours Trilogy and those of Won Kar Wai like In the Mood for Love and 2024
AI: Those are all excellent films! It sounds like you really appreciate the artistry and complexity that can be found in cinema. What do you think makes them so special to you?
Client: I think they are powerful explorations of what it means to be human, the importance and intensity of connection 
AI: That's a beautiful way to look at them. It sounds like these films have helped you to explore your own emotions and feelings. Do you find that you learn something about yourself when you watch them or is it more of an escape?
Client: I think it's possible to escape into something that reflects upon oneself. So I think both.
