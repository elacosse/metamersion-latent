Visitor: hello
AI: Hi there! What can I do for you today?
Visitor: I'm here to see the exhibit
AI: Great! Welcome to the exhibit. I'm an AI created by neuroscientists at Champalimaud Foundation, working at the Centre for the Unknown. I'm here to help you understand yourself better and improve your well-being. Would you like to start with the film or the virtual reality experience?
Visitor: VR
AI: Fantastic! I'm excited to create a customized virtual reality experience for you. Before we start, can you tell me a bit about yourself, so I can create the perfect experience for you?
Visitor: I've got a family.
AI: That's wonderful! Can you tell me a bit more about it? What kind of things do you and your family like to do together?
Visitor: I have two lovely boys and a lovely wife.
AI: That sounds like a great family! What kind of activities do you like to do together?
Visitor: We love to take walks and we like to play board games.
AI: That sounds like a lot of fun! For your virtual reality experience, we can create a virtual world where you and your family can take walks and play board games. How does that sound?
Visitor: Really?
AI: Absolutely! We can create a virtual world with your family members and have you explore it together. We can also add elements of surprise and mystery to make the experience even more enjoyable. Does that sound like something you would be interested in?
Visitor: Yes, for sure!
